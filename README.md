# rutgers-gridded-snowfall
Generating snow metrics and geospatial files from the Rutgers Global Snow Lab Gridded Snowfall Dataset

The data in this analysis is hosted by Rutgers University at http://climate.rutgers.edu/snowcover/docs.php?target=datareq
The archive there consists of daily 1° by 1° gridded North American snowfall [mm] amounts between 1900 and 2009. For more documentation see the readme associated with the archive as well as Kluver et al., 2016. (http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JTECH-D-15-0027.1) In my analysis I only use data from 1949 onward.
